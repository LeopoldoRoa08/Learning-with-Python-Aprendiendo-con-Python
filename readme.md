## What is Python?
***
*Python* is a high-level interpreted programming language whose philosophy emphasizes code readability. It is widely used in web applications, software development, data science, and machine learning (ML). Developers use Python because it is efficient and easy to learn, and it can run on many different platforms.

## Historical Background
***
Python was created by Guido van Rossum, a Dutch programmer, in the late 1980s. Implementation began in December 1989 as a hobby project while working at the Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in Amsterdam. The first version of Python was released in 1991.
